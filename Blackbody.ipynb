    "(a) Check the values illustrated in Fig 6.6 with the expression for the number density as a function of frequency from the lecture notes.\n",
    "Specifically, make a table that gives the following quantities, for six energy states: the three energy states shown in the figure, plus three additional states, $h\\nu_4 = 4kT_1$, $h\\nu_5 = 8kT_1$, $h\\nu_6 = 16kT_1$: \\\n",
    "(i) the number of cells $Z_c$, given a fixed bandwidth and two cells in frequency state 1, \\\n",
    "(ii) the average number $<n_c>$ of photons per cell, \\\n",
    "(iii) the total number of photons $N = <n_c>Z_c$, and \\\n",
    "(iv) the total energy $E = Nh\\nu$ in terms of $kT_1$. Is the figure consistent with your results? \\\n",
    "(b) Make a new table for the situation where the temperature is doubled, $T_2 = 2T_1$. Consider the same six states, $h\\nu_1 = 0.5kT_1$, $h\\nu_2 = 1kT_1$, and so on. Again calculate and tabulate $Z_c$, $<n_c>$, $N$, and $E$, the latter again in terms of $kT_1$. Before tabulating, consider first which of the tabulated quantities should change values when the temperature increases. Comment on the differences in the two tables, including the energy $h\\nu$ (in terms of $kT_1$) at which the total energy peaks."
